# Book Recommendation System

### Overview
This project is a book recommendation system that provides personalized book suggestions based on user preferences and interactions. It uses collaborative filtering to recommend books tailored to individual users by analyzing similar readers' preferences. Users can also select books by title, which triggers a hybrid filtering method — combining both collaborative filtering and content-based filtering — to suggest related books.

### Features
- Collaborative Filtering: Recommends books by identifying users with similar reading patterns and preferences.
- Hybrid Filtering: Combines collaborative and content-based filtering to generate more refined book recommendations.
- Top-Rated Books: The homepage showcases a curated list of the highest-rated books.
- User Profile: Upon selecting a user, the system displays:
   - Username and User ID
   - Number of books the user has rated
   - The 5 most recently rated books
### Technology Stack
- Backend: Flask (Python)
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
### How It Works
1. User-Based Recommendations: When a user selects a book or searches by title, recommendations are generated using hybrid filtering, ensuring personalized and content-relevant suggestions.
2. Best Rated Books: A featured list of top-rated books is displayed on the homepage to guide new users toward popular selections.
3. User Profile Information: For logged-in users, the system provides an overview of their activity, including the number of books they’ve rated and their five most recent ratings.<br><br>
